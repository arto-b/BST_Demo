\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \doxylink{class_stack}{Stack} class. 

This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_stack}{Stack} class member functions, which are used to support non-\/recursive traversal and deletion operations within a binary search tree, including in-\/order traversal and tree destruction.

The implementation is intentionally pointer-\/based and avoids the use of STL containers or smart pointers to demonstrate fundamental memory management concepts in C++.
