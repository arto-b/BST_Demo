\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declaration of the \doxylink{class_stack}{Stack} class. 

This header declares the \doxylink{class_stack}{Stack} class, which is used as an explicit stack to support non-\/recursive operations within the binary search tree. Specifically, it is utilized by the destroy\+Tree() method invoked by the \doxylink{class_b_s_t}{BST} destructor, as well as by the inorder() traversal method.

Its purpose is to assist in tree traversal and deletion operations while ensuring that all dynamically allocated memory is properly released.

Implementation details are defined in \doxylink{_stack_8cpp}{Stack.\+cpp}.
