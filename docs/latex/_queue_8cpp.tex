\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \doxylink{class_queue}{Queue} class. 

This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_queue}{Queue} class member functions, which are used to support non-\/recursive, level-\/order traversal operations within a binary search tree.

The implementation is intentionally pointer-\/based and avoids the use of STL containers or smart pointers to demonstrate fundamental memory management concepts in C++.
