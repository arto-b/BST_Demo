\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \doxylink{class_b_s_t}{BST} (Binary Search Tree) class. 

This file contains the iterative implementation of all \doxylink{class_b_s_t}{BST} operations, including insertion, search, deletion, traversal, and cleanup.

All algorithms are implemented without recursion, using explicit stack and queue data structures where appropriate. The \doxylink{class_b_s_t}{BST} owns all dynamically allocated \doxylink{class_node}{Node} objects and is responsible for their lifetime management.

This implementation is intentionally pointer-\/based and avoids the use of STL containers or smart pointers to demonstrate fundamental memory management concepts in C++.
