\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \doxylink{class_node}{Node} class. 

This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_node}{Node} class member functions, including accessor and mutator methods for managing node data and relationships.

The implementation is intentionally pointer-\/based and avoids the use of STL containers or smart pointers to demonstrate fundamental memory management concepts in C++.
